x fix match scouting form to make auto look less like teleop
x make current match update with scouting submissions
x make scouting selection use current match but also be able to show all
x shooting: change to made and missed (but keep DB and report using attempts)
x fix picture submission
x Defense Report- Specify auto/teleop or something; became a struggle when showing other teams the data (can even just be a key at the top of the table or in the heading)
x "Scout another tebaam" button after driver feedback form submission
x Put login/logout button on main menu so people actually do it
x walk through app with scouts, get on same page for entering data
x In Alliance Rankings, the official one from the blue alliance would be nice
